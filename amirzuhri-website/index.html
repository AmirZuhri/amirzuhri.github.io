            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="bio-content">
                <p>I was born on 24th October 1985 in Kuala Lumpur and spent most of my life in Subang Jaya. My academic journey began at Sekolah Sri Subang Jaya for my primary education, providing me with a strong foundation for my future studies. For my secondary education, I attended Sekolah Alam Shah, a prestigious full boarding school located in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. The school has since relocated to Putrajaya, but during my time there, it was known for its rigorous academic standards and emphasis on holistic development.</p>
                
                <p>In 2002, I completed my SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia) examinations with impressive results of 8As and 1B. This academic achievement opened doors for me, leading to my enrollment in Universiti Teknologi Petronas where I obtained a Foundation Certificate in Engineering. My time at the university was invaluable, providing me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that would later serve me well in my professional career.</p>
                
                <p>During my school years, I was actively involved in sports, particularly rugby and athletics at Sekolah Alam Shah. These activities not only kept me physically fit but also taught me important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. The camaraderie and experiences gained from these sporting activities have significantly shaped my character and approach to life's challenges.</p>
                
                <p>Following my foundation studies, I pursued further education at SeGi College Subang Jaya, where I earned a Diploma in Electrical Engineering. This qualification equipped me with specialized technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities that have been instrumental throughout my professional journey.</p>
                
                <p>My career has been remarkably diverse, spanning multiple industries and roles. I began in government project contracting, where I learned about public sector operations and the intricacies of project management. From there, I transitioned to the Renewable Energy sector, with a particular focus on Solar energy and Energy Efficiency solutions. This role aligned with my engineering background and allowed me to contribute to sustainable development initiatives.</p>
                
                <p>My professional path then led me to the field of biodegradable materials, specifically working with PLA (Polylactic Acid) for tableware and various other applications. This experience introduced me to sustainable product development and environmental conservation efforts. Following this, I briefly worked as a ship chandler, providing supplies and services to vessels operated by Jasa Merin Sdn Bhd. This role exposed me to the maritime industry and its unique operational challenges.</p>
                
                <p>Later, I ventured into Internet Marketing, where I was responsible for promoting and selling a local brand of skincare products. This position allowed me to develop digital marketing skills and gain insights into consumer behavior and e-commerce strategies. After two years in this field, I found my calling in the social impact sector.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I serve as a Program Assistant in a Social Impact NGO, where I leverage my diverse experience to contribute to meaningful social initiatives. This role allows me to utilize my technical background, problem-solving abilities, and interpersonal skills to make a positive difference in society. The cross-industry experience I've accumulated over the past 13+ years has provided me with a unique perspective and versatile skill set that I bring to my current position.</p>
